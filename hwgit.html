      <h2>What is GIT? Why do we need source code Version Control System?</h2>
      <p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It is used to track changes in source code during software development. Git is very easy to learn and its performance is lightning fast. Git can be used on any operating system through a number of different programs(Linux command-line, Gitbash, windows command-line, etc.). Graphical application is also available.
        <br>Version Control System:
        <br>  Real life projects generally have multiple developers working in parallel. So a version control system is needed to ensure there are no code conflicts between the developers.
        <br>Additionally, the requirements in such projects change often. So a version control system allows developers to revert and go back to an older version of the code.
        <br><br> 1. If we accidentally delete your code, Version Control System(VCS) can help us get it back.
        <br> 2. If we accidentally change our code and break something, VCS can revert it.
        <br> 3. DVCS like Git lets us share and exchange code with other developers easily.
        <br> 4. If we want to know what recent changes we made to code, VCS will show us.
        <br> 5. VCS lets us backup our code easily to a remote server.
        <br><br> Gitâ€™s flexibility and popularity make it a great choice for any team. Many developers and college graduates already know how to use Git.

      <h2>Describe following terms: 1) local repo 2) remote repo 3) how to use GIT in Team Project - multiple developers work on the same project at the same time</h2>
      <p> There are exactly two types of repository, Local and Remote.
        <br>1) Local repo : The local repository is a directory on our computer. It caches remote downloads and contains temporary build artifacts that you have not yet released. It can be used during offline. We do all the changes in our local repository, test the changes, than we can commit the changes to remote repositry when we are online again.
        <br><br> 2) Remote repo: Remote repo is required when there are more than 1 developer working on the same project. In that case, we need to share the code and than we need all the features which version control provides. Technically, a remote repository doesn't differ from a local one: it contains branches, commits, and tags just like a local repository. A remote repository doesn't have such a working directory: it only consists of the bare ".git" repository folder.
        <br><br> 3) How to use GIT in Team Project:
        <br> 1. Create the repository on Github and give access to all the developers
        <br> 2. Create a new branch to work on for each developer
        <br> 3. Each developer will write the code and Commit regularly
        <br> 4. Fetch only when you are done
        <br> 5. Push the changes to the branch
        <br> 6. If ready to make the pull request, one person out of the team will merge the branch's code with Master
        <br> 7. When finshed with a feature or part of application and everything has been merged already, delete the branch associated with it.
