      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is a tool designed to make it easy to create, deploy and run applications by using containers. Docker and containers work in group. 1 docker can host multiple containers. Containers allow us to package up an application as standardized unit – combine all the parts it needs, like libraries, custom settings in operating system, system tools, etc. and ship this standardized unit as one package. By doing this, we are rest assured and thanks to containers, that the application will run on any machine(Linux) regardless of customized settings that were done on the machine used for development of application. 
        <br> In other terms, Docker is similar to virtual machine, but rather than creating a whole virtual operating system, Docker allows application to use the same Linux kernel as the system they are running on and only ship things that are not running on host computer. So, in this way, we are enabled to separate our applications from infrastructure and deliver it faster(reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production). 
        <br> Docker is an operating system for containers. It uses host OS kernel and there is no custom or additional kernel inside the containers.

      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
      <p>Nginx is a free, open source, high performance web server and reverse proxy as well as HTTP cache and it runs on Linux OS. Nginx offers a quite number of features which include basic 4 layers load balancing - to do the load balancing among different containers running on a same machine and expose a private port to real world so the real world can access the application running in container. Nginx was the answer to the C10K problem.
      <br> Nginx offers low memory usage and high concurrency that is why it is most popular among high traffic websites. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. Nginx has also the capacity to operate as an IMAP/POP3 mail proxy server.

      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      <p>Virtual machine, usually knows as guest, is a computer file that behaves like an actual standalone computer and provides functionality of a physical computer. Typically, it is an image. It runs in a window, much like any other program, creating computer within a computer giving the exact same user experience as the host operating system itself. Virtual machine is a sandbox from the rest of the system, ideal environment for testing other operating systems.
      <br> As the virtual machine is just like any other program, Yes, we can run multiple virtual machine simultaneously on the same physical computer. Each virtual machine has its virtual hardware like, own memory, CPUs, hard drives, network interfaces etc. Virtual machines are implemented by software emulation methods or hardware virtualization techniques.

      <h2>Who is Cloud Computing Service Provider - Digitalocean</h2>
      <p>Digital ocean is an American cloud infrastructure provider founded in 2011, headquartered in New York city with data centers all over the world. It is a cloud computing vendor that offers an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform for software developers that help to deploy and scale applications.
      <br>DigitalOcean lets us create, automate, and manage a robust cloud server infrastructure with out of the box features like floating IP addresses, shared private networking, Tier-1 bandwidth, team accounts and SSD (solid-state drive) hard drives come as standard.
      <br>To do this, developer launches a private VM instance, Digital ocean calls it “Droplet”. They offer 9 droplet sizes, smallest is 512MB ram, 1 CPU and 20GB SSD and all this at $5 a month. Largest droplet is 64GB ram, 20CPUs and 640 GB SSD at the rate of $640 per month.
